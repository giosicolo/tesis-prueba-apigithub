2807,Chrome-specific JS debugging: dragging the increment mode number field sometimes jumps at the start,open,https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/2807,Keavon,"Help Wanted,Good First Issue,Web,Paper Cut",,0,,2025-06-30T22:23:16Z,2025-06-30T22:33:51Z,,,No,"This has happened for a long time, but I should really file an issue, so here it is. It seems to probably happen only in Chrome, unless perhaps it is just harder to reproduce in Firefox (I wasn't able to reproduce it in FF in my testing right now, but haven't ruled it out). See `NumberInput.svelte`.  When you click and drag a number input field of the increment (not range) style, meaning the kind you can drag infinitely left or right, it will sometimes teleport the value to a wildly different value from the one it started with. This can be reproduced by drawing a rectangle and dragging left and right on its stroke weight parameter in the Properties panel repeatedly in quick, small left and right drags until occasionally it will make a big jump.  I hypothesize this is caused by weirdness in the event ordering and mouse position reporting with the [pointer lock](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API) API, and it might be related to the widget being broken in Safari: #2038. I recommend logging the values that are being reported by the API and current state every frame to narrow down when the events occur and produce the discrepancy.  At the the 4-second mark in this video, we see it jump from `131.3` to `17.3` immediately when the click-and-drag begins:  https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61b1b1e6-4560-4555-aac5-f7b54cbfacb9"

There are four options, and it's up to the renderer what it wants to do with each.

Here is an example:  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a616a08e-9fee-4782-aefa-e53c0fbe4b7e)    The top example can be set to Auto (the default if not overridden) or Geometric Precision and get the same output as before this was implemented.  The bottom can be set to Crisp Edges or Optimize Speed to get the result shown. Notably, on the bottom, AA is off for stroke and fill edges on the flower, along with the interface between the fill and stroke on the red shape. The outer edge of the stroke is still antialiased. If I change the stroke from Inside to Center or Outside, the anti-aliasing goes away.    Useful function for a technical user, but consistency in support is lacking."

2779,"Paints (solid color, gradient, pattern, and other existing graphical data)",open,https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/2779,Keavon,"Architecture,Graphics",,0,,2025-06-28T06:18:27Z,2025-06-28T06:37:16Z,,,No,"A **paint** is something that's graphical, which can be given to a Fill or Stroke node to be applied to the appearance of a vector path or stroke area.  For Graphite, we should use a model where a paint can be any graphical data: 1. As a layer, it shows up with finite or infinite bounds in the render like normal. It may be clipped to a layer beneath it via a clipping mask. 2. As a fill paint, it shows up only within the fill area of a vector path. 3. As a stroke paint, it shows up only within the stroke area of a vector path.  Right now, we support any graphical **element** in case 1 (part of the render), but only the `FillChoice` enum which can be `None`/a solid `Color`/the `Gradient` struct for case 2 (vector fills), and only a `Color` for case 3 (vector strokes). This change calls for making the **Fill** and **Stroke** nodes accept any graphical data (i.e., anything that can be type-coerced into a graphical element) as opposed to their current parameters.  Then for colors and gradients, both of these types need to be added to the graphical element enum, allowing layers of color or gradient data to display infinitely in all directions. This solves the requested feature for choosing a background color of an infinite canvas, by simply making it be the bottom layer.  For patterns, we will have a sort of pattern tiling node which uses the footprint to render the infinite data. This can be implemented after the colors and gradients from the previous paragraph with insights gleaned from that process.  An alternative to adding these to the graphic element enum is that we could have a type coercion node that generates a vector rectangle with the footprint bounds, and fills it with the color, gradient, or pattern stroke. So feeding a color into a layer, a fill paint, or a stroke paint, would just type coerce it into a filled rectangle vector element of the appropriate size to cover the rendered area. This helps avoid needing to keep extending the graphic element enum and adding more rendering implementations to it.  We do need to update the renderer code to produce SVG output syntax for fill and stroke paints. For ordinary graphical data, this could work by using a `<pattern>` (without the infinite tiling unless the user has created an infinite pattern with the data) or clip/mask. For color, this needs to become a standard fill color, and for gradient, likewise.  Paint transforms need to also be preserved, so a scaled/skewed paint can be drawn with that stretch applied, just like we do for a skewed gradient right now using `Gradient::transform`.

Example of usecase that is broken by AA: I've been working on a project that involves stroking paths with a series of circles that change color based on distance from the start of the path. I can then use a specialized shader in a raster pipeline to threshold the image, giving a hand-drawn line that can be 'drawn' in real time with extremely light loads on both CPU and GPU. To do this, I need every pixel of a circle to be either 100% the desired color or entirely transparent. Anything inbetween results in artifacts.

2756,"[BUG] Persistent ""New Document"" Popup",closed,https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/2756,PedroMAdorno4,,,21,"[PedroMAdorno4]: This was on the editor.graphite.rs website, which I dont know how up-to-date it is with the dev branch  | [Keavon]: - Have you tried closing the editor and opening it again? - Do you have something physically pressing down the keys on your keyboard? Does this continue if you unplug your keyboard? - Do you have any kind of macros that simulate key presses running on your computer? | [PedroMAdorno4]: I have tried, sometimes it opens my ""old"" document with the image, sometimes it does not get to that and glitches at the 'new document' popup. I in fact, do not know where that old image/document is being stored since via developer tools console, no such stored data is shown. Answering directly: 1) Yes, sometimes glitches on the 'new document' popup, sometimes loads my old document with the image where i cant do anything due to lag 2) No, I have not / continues even without keyboard 3) No macros as well  I can assure you there are no inputs being spammed physically or virtually | [Keavon]: What browser are you using? And can you try a different browser to see if this happens there? | [PedroMAdorno4]: I think I got a clue as to what caused it now. I believe I opened my image reference file via the ""Open (ctrl+o)"" action instead of the ""Import (ctrl+i)"" action. | [PedroMAdorno4]: I am using firefox and did try using brave, but same thing happened | [PedroMAdorno4]: In the ""Open"" menu, when it opens the file dialog, if I switch it to ""All files"" instead of "".graphite"" ones, and import the image that way, it lags the hell out of the app | [PedroMAdorno4]: Can u try reproducing it that way? | [Keavon]: What OS?  In Firefox dev tools (<kbd>F12</kbd>), go to the Storage tab, expand ""Indexed DB"" on the left side bar, expand the URL, then right click on ""graphite (default)"" and click delete. Then reload the page. Does this make it stop happening once you create a new document? | [PedroMAdorno4]: I'm on NixOS, revision 08f22084e6085d19bcfb4be30d1ca76ecb96fe54 of nixpkgs.  Also, running Hyprland. Don't know if it changes anything, but maybe some rendering stuff is involved?  Cleaning everything from the ""Indexed DB"" for graphite on firefox did solve it when I reopened it.  But it happens again if I redo it. | [Keavon]: From a clean slate, what are the precise, detailed steps to reproduce the problem? A video would be helpful as a supplement to the listed steps. | [PedroMAdorno4]: Yes, of course. Here we go. It apparently happens when importing via the ""Import (ctrl+i)"" menu as well.  I just recorded it. After selecting the image and pressing Open, I try to scroll the canvas but its unresponsive. I show it shortly after by hovering over the toolbar icons.  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68af20ac-e2cd-4191-a5cf-57df49621068)  I could not reproduce the new document glitch, unfortunately | [PedroMAdorno4]: Sry, took a while to convert the video to a gif so I could upload it here.  | [PedroMAdorno4]: I could see what I showed on that last gif as a separate issue, but I do think they are correlated | [PedroMAdorno4]: I'll send the picture I used as well   <details><summary>Picture</summary> <p>  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/102a0f81-9fa8-4272-bcaa-3d678f5febfe)  </p> </details>   | [Keavon]: Importing and rendering high-resolution images, shown in your clip, is a known performance limitation at the moment (vector and low-resolution raster is all we recommend using until the future when that's resolved). But this issue—being spammed with a constantly reopening New Document dialog—is unrelated to that, right? | [PedroMAdorno4]: Ah, I see. That is indeed a separate issue then. However, the originally reported one is definitely there since it just happened again to me. I'll dial in how to reproduce it and come back | [PedroMAdorno4]: It does seem to be an issue related to storage and how it is being loaded. It always happens when the image loads, even though both indexed dbs (firefox and brave) were empty (and still are after the glitched loading). Maybe some caching issues? The image does seem to be coming back from empty air from me, even though the dbs are cleared and I even deleted it from the layers manually from the browsers | [PedroMAdorno4]: Maybe an issue from using it with multiple browsers? Seems unlikely for me for now, but I'll try to get some nice steps to reproduce it. I'll be back eventually with hopefully good news.   | [Keavon]: Just note that, after clearing the storage by right-clicking to delete it from the sidebar as I described above, you have to also reload the page. | [Keavon]: I'll close this at least temporarily, but reopen it if I hear back with a production. It's also possible it could have been a one-off bug from an outdated file.",2025-06-26T02:11:14Z,2025-06-26T11:08:27Z,2025-06-26T11:08:27Z,,No,"I created a sketch and imported an image I took with my phone. Immediately, performance dropped to perhaps sub-1 fps. Hovering over anything didn´t show anything, nor did trying via shortcuts. Some time later, I decided to start a sketch from scratch, and when selecting the ""New document"" 'OK' option, it opened my previous ""document"" with the image that lagged everything, and the ""new document"" popup persisted. I'm including a short video, but the issue seems to be a width event listener not being de-registered and causing the bug.  Basically, I'm stuck with ""New Document"" popup and it doesn't matter if I'm on a new document or not, nor does pressing ""ok"" or ""cancel"" change anything  Images show a thousand words, so here we go:  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f11b852-abe2-4f21-8fe3-59d4028ed3c7)"

Problem arises because applying `colinear handles` on the first node will create the opposite handle.

This is rather hard to manage or debug. - Split message handlers - Move complex logic outside of the match statement  ## Cloning the document History / transactions involve cloning the document many times. This very bad for performance and completely inflexible [#2617](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/2617) . The [issue from 2021](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/123) still hasn't had any progress due to the enormous refactoring that would be involved in making a system with proper actions. The current system also creates much confusion when history interacts with tools (especially the pen tool [#2262](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/2262). - Write a system whereby actions and their reverse can be stored instead. This will require a major refactor. I don't really want to undertake this whilst so many of the systems are in flux  ## UI UI code is verbose and poorly structured. The current system is partially immediate mode, using all of our custom types. All of the UI is then diffed in a rather fragile way. The callback system is also rather confusing causing issues like [#2530](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/2530). - Rewrite using a better UI library e.g. iced. Keavon wants to adopt some research project but I'm not sure this is a good idea. - Make the API for the UI layout more like egui to improve simplicity.   ## Transforms & Click targets Transforms are completely broken in many situations. Especially with the node graph allowing transform nodes in any position. There are a series of inconsistent hacks that work around this is certain common situations. However this isn't particularly ideal. The Instances<T> only makes this more confusing. I'm not really sure how to solve this.  Click targets are very confusingly managed. This includes the path tool without a path node. This also interacts with the transform system in ways that aren't particularly robust.  The StartBuffer thing is exceedingly confusing. Each time there is an issue involving it, several hours must be spent trying to figure out what to do about it.  The relationship where the editor updates are theoretically independent of the node graph executor is very confusing since most tools rely on the node grpah being run at least most of the time. This is especially confusing when implementing tests.  I feel like the current systems and the way they interact with the node graph is very hacky. I think it would be best to discuss the requirements for the system to figure out why we have ended up in such a mess.  ## Tools - Some tools have a confusing amount of state. For example PenToolData has 31 member variables which are only set is certain situations. This has lead to many bugs. - FSM states are inconsistent and confusing. For example the select tool fsm state for `Ready` contains the `NestedSelectionBehaviour` and the `Dragging` state contains the `has_dragged: bool` for some reason?  I feel like some of the tools need a rewrite @Keavon. However there is always a lot of random churn.  ## Inputs Rebinding inputs has been requested for a long time. However the input system has thousands of lines of macros involving many repeated things that would require a significant amount of refactoring to make a system that could be exposed to the user.  ## Translations Translations are basically impossible to implement now since there are many thousands of string literals scattered all over the code including gcore, editor, frontend svelte etc.  ## Multiple documents Having multiple documents visible at once seems to be a goal at some point. It is probably very useful for references / having a zoomed out overview etc. However we have hardcoded the active document many many times so it is basically impossible to refactor this.  ## SVG Poor integration with SVG. SVG imports are all flattened to a path rather than maintaining any structure at all. Exports end up as a mess of nested groups that is mostly unusable.  Vector editing performance is very bad with large documents (e.g. try dragging a layer in the red dress demo artwork)."

That including all it's dependents, like `wgpu`, `gcore` and pretty much every single crate in this repo. This makes it super annoying to build or check different crates in the tree. So I unified all features in the workspace `Cargo.toml`.    Sure, *usually* you only use `graphene-cli` or `graphite-wasm` as the main targets, but I've noticed it quite a bit. Also simplifies all active features of a crate to a single location, instead of all over the codebase. Which helps me later when I don't have to think about features when refactoring."

The 'Solidify Stroke' node creates at least two paths, but the `append_bezpath` method only appends the first path, and hence 'Solidify Stroke' didn't work correctly.    Fix:  Now `AppendBezpath::append_bezpath()` appends all the paths in the given BezPath, which also fixes the 'Solidify Stroke' node.
