I ran this on a circle and found the following results for the number of times that we run the hot path Kurbo function, `PathSeg::intersect_line`, inside our `ActiveListLevel::new_filled` function:    ```  102,987 (After: With Caching)  203,505 (Before: No Caching)  ```    After it builds the initial dart board grid of the user's chosen point density, we also have one other location where `intersect_line` is used, when the dart board is subdivided. This only happened about 8000 times during the same above case, and because it subdivides the grid, it's harder to use a hash map in that case and there would be significantly more cache misses, so I didn't attempt to cache that part.    Further optimization work is still needed to help with avoiding creating the high-density initial dart board across the full bounding box area, by breaking it apart into a spatial data structure so large areas inside and outside the shape can be checked with fewer tests for insideness and intersection. We want to efficiently discard large areas that are fully inside and fully outside while only doing denser geometry boundary checks near the actual vector segments.    Despite the 50% reduction in the bottlenecked calls, we seem to only be reducing our AnimationFrame duration from 170 to 150 milliseconds.

This also cleans up how we write the code for generating widget rows for the Properties panel by putting the many function arguments into a reused struct.

We want hovering to show a rectangular bounding box of what would get selected by clicking. Inside that is the item which will get selected by double-clicking (by ""digging down"" a level in the nesting). We also want that to show a bounding box at 50% opacity to indicate it would become selected by double-clicking. Instead of showing this 50% opacity bounding box, we should show the actual shape outline (the same one that we have right now on hover) at 50% opacity if double-clicking would select an object (rather than a group). And if that shape would get selected by single-clicking it, then we don't show any bounding boxes but we show the shape outline at 100% opacity just as we do today.

Manually enter a value in the rotation field (e.g. 45°).  Observe that the shape jumps to another position instead of rotating in place.  Try rotating the same shape using the canvas rotation tool with the mouse — the shape rotates correctly without changing position.

We can see this by noticing how: - Box selection of a single corner anchor makes it show      ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05d216e8-d432-45d2-a0b2-1981678955c4)  - As opposed to, when clicking      ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/111b948b-1c1a-456f-b56c-fb01d645f177)  In this video, each mouse wiggle occurs after pressing `G` (of GRS):  https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b306093-4516-46cd-9e03-dbfadd0d695a  The symptoms described above are probably a pairing of two separate issues that both need to be fixed."

For example, if you draw in a tilted viewport, it shouldn't draw a tilted shape since that should be compensated for. And for example, if you draw inside of a group which has its own transform, your drawing won't be aligned with your cursor because it now fails to compensate for that.

However, in these cases, stroke.transform is not correctly set.    Since the stroke is considered valid regardless, the original check prevented it from falling back to instance.transform() when necessary. To fix this, I added an additional check to ensure that the stroke is only treated as valid if its weight is greater than 0. Otherwise, we should use the fallback instead of relying on the default stroke.transform."

I'd like to add these triangles that appear when hovering over an edge's resize click target. Only the edge for which you're hovering should show the pair of triangles. Triangles are the same dimensions as the squares (7 x 7 px), but with a vertex at `7 / 2 = 3.5` instead of the square's corners. They are located 4 px away from the square. After adding this, we can remove the `Ctrl` shortcut which isn't needed anymore since this is easier and more discoverable. However, when dragging a triangle, `Ctrl` can be assigned to allow the dragging of the entire edge instead of just sliding it. Meaning it's allowed to follow the cursor along both the local X and local Y axis, not just sliding along the local X or Y axis (whichever edge is being dragged). If `Ctrl` is released while dragging, it should return to its previous sliding-only position, as if the user had never held `Ctrl` but merely moved the cursor around, only sliding it along the local axis. The hints, during the skew sliding, should indicate that `Ctrl` unlocks the slide."

Likewise for a `-` hint to show you can negate the value.  - [x] A one-frame visual bug: if you `S`, `Y`, move the mouse so the scale becomes negative, then `Y` to turn it to a local scale; for one frame it becomes un-inverted:    - [x] In `R` mode, there should be no separator line at the very end of the hints bar, when nothing comes after it.  - [x] All G/R/S modes and states need to have a separate section at the start for left click or <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm and right click or <kbd>Esc</kbd> to cancel (copy latter from the hints when drawing a line, and adapt it for the former case).  - Removed: I'd like to try, once more, seeing what it looks like for the uniform (non-axis-constrained) scaling to follow the cursor rather than sticking to the original angle when the scaling began.

It should not be doing that, instead it should be displaying the actual scale ratio. 0 means at the center. 1 means at the starting point of the Sscale. 0.5 means half is solid, half is dashed. Notice in my video below, I'm able to make the solid line's end go all the way to the center, which should occur at a scale factor of 0, without ever having the scale factor even go below 0.5. Because currently the two values aren't related. Furthermore, this is necessary to visualize snapping when Ctrl is pressed and to properly handle slowing when Shift is pressed. [Video](https://files.keavon.com/-/QuirkyYummyGrayfox/capture_38_.mp4)  - [x] Implement integer-value snapping for Grab when Ctrl is pressed? It should work whether we're freely moving or constrained to X or Y (but still mouse controlled; Ctrl doesn't affect typed numbers). So when Ctrl is held, we shouldn't see decimal values. You'll need to zoom in past 100% to see decimal values.  - [x] We don't enter G, R, or S mode until after pressing one of those keys and then moving the mouse cursor. It should happen immediately upon pressing the key, before needing to move the cursor.  - [x] The hints need to be updated to work dynamically with the state of global vs. local X and Y constraint, and include `-` negation, numbers, and Backspace if numbers are typed.  - [x] In the Path tool, we actually do want the Rotation to start from the direction of the cursor rather than the local rotation of the layer. So if you can undo that change specifically for the Path tool, but keep it for the Select tool, that would be ideal.  - [x] When G is constrained to Y in both Path and Select tools, the number label shouldn't swap sides based on moving the mouse left and right offset by the pivot-to-start-point X offset distance. Alternatively, you could keep this behavior but make it swap to the side that the mouse is currently on (removing the pivot-to-start-point X offset from the current mouse position). When solving this, just be sure you don't break the correct behavior for G when unconstrained to an axis, since we like how the Y component label swaps sides. Please also double-check that you're not drawing any extra (overlapping) overlay lines than the necessary 1 when in X or Y constraint mode, or when X or Y happen to be precisely 0. [Video](https://files.keavon.com/-/EachWeeArcticseal/capture_39_.mp4)  - [x] Remove the bottom-left viewport overlay labels for the G/R/S status  - [x] If you type `-` it negates the mouse-controlled GRS. Then if you type a number, it becomes that negative number. If you then type `-` it negates that number, etc."

Events that happen at the same time (such as `click` and `mouseup` and `pointerup`) don't get fired in the same order in FF as in Chrome. This has caused problems in the past. The solution is tracing the logic and then updating it to be more robust to either ordering. This is a sizable chance that some of the debugging will take place in the Rust code, not just `NumberInput.svelte` and other frontend code.  For only the tool control bar (the left side of the control bar, above the viewport), if you drag left/right on number input boxes (such as ""Diameter"" for the Brush tool, ""Weight"" for any of the vector drawing tools, also the Polygon and Text tool's various number inputs, but apparently **not** the ""X""/""Y"" point position of the Path tool).

The first part of this issue involves simply devising an algorithm to produce the coordinates of these snake ends/bends, with the end points specified and the offsets of the shiftable segments given as an array. Then constructing an SVG path that rounds/fillets the corners. Subsequent work can then integrate it as a replacement for the existing curve code ([see this code](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/blob/set-text-width/editor/src/messages/portfolio/document/node_graph/node_graph_message_handler.rs#L2351)) and determine the appropriate array of segment shifts to produce a result that nicely avoids overlapping nodes and other wires, as shown in the high-fidelity node graph UI mockup above.

If <kbd>Shift</kbd> is held down before dragging, this lets the box selection *add* to the selection instead of *replacing* the existing selection.    Sometimes, users want more precise control over the region being selected than a rectangle can accommodate. For that, we'd like to have lasso selection. It should be triggered if <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> is held down before dragging. Unlike box selection described above where <kbd>Shift</kbd> has to be held down to *add* instead of *replacing* the selection, lasso selection will always *add* to the selection. Another difference from box selection is that the lasso must fully encompass the layer, rather than just barely touching it (as with box selection), to be included in the selection. Here's how it should work (a video mockup made using Blender):    https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5596190-1711-4e18-857e-00da14195419    The overlay system for drawing the blue lines, which is used for drawing the box selection rectangle, will also need to be used to draw the polyline of each mouse coordinate visited during the lasso selection drag. I don't think we currently have an existing function in the overlays system for drawing a polyline but it should be easy to adapt an existing function for that purpose."

A full node level override for the entire panel is still possible, which is stored as a lambda in the definition. Modifying the imports/exports means that the reference is lost, and the properties are instead generated individually for each input. By default, this will use the data type/type annotation to generate an appropriate set of widgets. This is done in `property_from_type`. For custom input overrides, each input has the PropertiesRow struct, which can store a reference to a widget override (a lambda which will generate a custom set of widgets). This lambda is stored in a hashmap, since it would not be possible to serialize it for every node. This also makes it easily extendible, just like how the definitions are stored. This lambda has access to the entire network interface, which it can use to access any information it needs to generate the widget. In addition to the widget override reference, each input also stores a hashmap of serializable data, which can store any information necessary.

Presently, if I use the Line tool to draw a line:  ![capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be759a8a-8319-456a-abc6-f4a65d2ab905)  It doesn't produce just a Line node with *Start* and *End* set to the appropriate coordinates. Instead, it uses the unit line `(0, 0)` to `(1, 0)` and applies some highly scaled transform with a Transform node to actually position it in space:  ![capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e27af1d5-ee60-4885-8983-dab4f2f1cd74)  The desired result of drawing with the Line tool shouldn't include a Transform node.  `line_tool.rs` is a good place to start looking for this code (although it could potentially be in a helper function in another file).  ---  This also happens with the Rectangle tool:  ![capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51a15460-b14f-45c6-87cd-536443982d87) ![capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bc78408-6429-4778-8514-4c0b608fdb20)  Here, the rectangle is a unit square (`1`x`1` units). The desired result of drawing with the Rectangle tool should apply the scale to the Rectangle node and the translation (and if the canvas is tilted, also rotation) to the Transform node, leaving it at the default scale factor of `1`x`1`.  `rectangle_tool.rs` is a good place to start looking for this code.  ---  This also happens with the Ellipse tool:  ![capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0188ccb9-ba06-49a4-803a-19ff52db39de) ![capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b4b283f-d89b-471e-969b-ead33f7ebcc7)  The desired behavior is the same as the Rectangle tool.  `ellipse_tool.rs` is a good place to start looking for this code.  ---  This also happens with the Polygon tool, in ""convex"" mode:  ![capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e609d6ed-8940-4122-b2ea-0d8feb95cb88) ![capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c8b1b2e-5dd5-4cf6-bc1d-917fbd85acec)  And in ""star"" mode:  ![capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/345209e5-f7cd-4952-b771-6172046d3a07) ![capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a699bee4-9ba9-4f44-b55b-b690930c882e)  In this case, like with Ellipse and Rectangle, we want to represent the scale with the shape generator nodes. However, because the Star and Regular Polygon nodes don't have parameters for non-uniform aspect ratios, the Transform node will still need to represent the stretch factor. We just don't want to use the unit (`1`x`1`) shapes anymore. It would probably be preferable to represent the smaller dimension as a scale factor of `1` in the Transform node so that the larger dimension can be represented as a value larger than `1` in the Transform node in order to give it the desired stretch.  `polygon_tool.rs` is a good place to start looking for this code."

That's because it currently is moving relative to the viewport coordinates, but it should always work relative to the document coordinates so 10 units to the right means the same thing regardless of the current level of zoom. It also shouldn't be in the layer's local coordinate space, where a shape that has a 0.1 scale factor would take 10 times as many presses to travel the intended distance. The Select tool's nudging can be referenced for this, because it works correctly in document space (not layer-local or viewport space)."

In the issue it mentions that it is necessary to store input types in the `NodeNetwork` struct for the into system. I am unsure of how exactly the into insertion system would be implemented. However I don't believe the proposed change would help at all.  In order to insert an into node, you need to resolve the type of the input. Types are only resolved after flattening. After flattening the nested network inputs are no longer accessible. This makes storing a list of input types in the `NodeNetwork` entirely redundant.    This change necessitated passing the types to the top level network to the compile function. This is only required for the inputs to the TOP LEVEL node network. This doesn't impact copy pasting or in any other way limit the flexibility of the graph. When you compile a network and then call it, you already know what types you are going to call it with (for the editor this is `concrete!(RenderConfig)`).    Even if further work is required for this issue, I think this PR represents an improvement as it avoids storing redundant and unused data within the complex network data structures."

For protonodes, this would require accessing the list of implementations, which are defined in the node macro. The implementations would then be filtered based on the current type of all other inputs to return a list of all currently valid types for that input. Network nodes are a bit more complex, since the inputs will undergo automatic type casting ([2042](<https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/2042>)), and all usages need to be valid.

Now, the progression of intervals is:    ...200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5,7(6.25), 4(3.125), 2(...),1    ## Discussion    I chose to start rounding at 12.5 since 12.5 is a fairly legible number. It only started looking weird below that. A slight issue is that 7 is used when 6.25 is rounded up, which isn't a clean number for the ruler :shrug:. I couldn't think of a clean way to get it to 8 or 6 without messing up the other numbers (i thought about something like: `ruler_interval += ruler_interval % 2` to force evenness, but then `ruler_interval` bottoms out at 2, which felt too big).     ## Results    When toggling the node graph display, the ruler now looks like this:  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f0d903b-d2e6-41fb-a43c-669683da1727)    And for very high zoom percentages (> 60000%), the ruler tops out at an interval of 1.   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99b75cf7-7861-4706-947f-fbd775d22dec)    Previously, the long decimals would overlap each other and look bad:  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0300704-614a-437d-b9a8-dbef1a8e0740)       "

1932,Vertically repositioning layers should push layers above/below it like blocks,closed,https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/1932,Keavon,Paper Cut,adamgerhant,0,2024-08-14T05:31:46Z,2025-01-19T22:02:40Z,2024-08-22T08:56:33Z,Milestone 40,No,"When you drag a layer in a stack up or down, and it runs into the layers above/below it, we want the behavior to work based on this physical analogy:    Wooden blocks are strewn across the floor in a line. Any block can be pushed, which will accumulate blocks in the ""wave of blocks"" with one block at the front of the push, which continues to meet additional blocks in front of it as collisions occur, growing the wave and transferring the front further along to new blocks. Blocks fit together like puzzle pieces, so collision detection along the entire top/bottom surface is necessary. If the push is retracted, all the blocks get elastically pulled back towards their starting places by rubber bands that pinned them to their starting positions, but they will travel no further than being restored back to where they began.    Algorithm:  - When dragging begins, the vertical positions of all the layers (and their upstream nodes that feed in through primary or secondary flow) have their positions stored, like they are ""held in place by rubber bands"".  - The selected layer (or if multiple, this occurs for all of them) starts as the ""front"" (like a ""wave front"" or ""storm font"").  - The front detects collision in the direction of travel between the selected nodes and the with the *next* nodes in the direction of travel. When shifting up this is any nodes downstream of the moved nodes. When shifting down this is any nodes upstream of the shifted nodes. This means when shifting down, dangling nodes of the selected layer are treated the same as the upstream sibling layer. These upstream absolute nodes are treated as ""loose"" meaning they will get pushed together if there is space (possibly recreating a chain), and if they are touching then force would be transferred through them.  - If a collision occurs, the role of being the front is switched to that layer and it (plus its upstream nodes that were part of the collision area) get pushed along with the wave of blocks.  - If the user reverses direction and backs off, the ""rubber bands"" attempt to push all layers (and associated nodes that also got shifted) back to their starting positions, but no further.  - When the user releases the pointer click, the drag is over and the ""rubber bands"" are erased.    Implementation:  - Get an ordered list of layer and nodes to be shifted based on the current selection, and the vertical direction of the shift. A shift down sorts the nodes with the greatest y position first. Collision detection should only be performed for layers and nodes that are upstream from a layer being moved.  - Get a list of all nodes to check collision with. For a shifted node, it gets the downstream layer it is connected to (with the tuple), all upstream nodes of the layer which are not selected (since selected nodes would never get intersected due to the ordering), the upstream/downstream layer based on the direction, and all nodes upstream of that layer. For a shifted layer, it checks all upstream nodes, the layer above/below based on direction, and all nodes upstream of that layer.  - Get a list of colliding nodes if there is a collision or negative y offset after the shift with the selected node. Run the entire function for this group of colliding nodes (as if they were selected and shifted), then run the entire function again for the node/layer. A recursion limit can be applied to prevent extreme shifting, and allow overlap instead.  - For an upward shift, the selected nodes are shifted top to bottom, and each shift sends a wave from bottom to top in order to make space for that node. This means there can be multiple ""wave fronts"" if multiple nodes are selected in a stack, but not those in between.  - Collapsing space due to rubber banding will be handled by the node graph message handler, since this requires saving state and should not happen during programmatic shifts."
1931,"The Transform node sets its GraphicGroup's final transform, but should only affect the data-so-far in the graph flow",closed,https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/1931,Keavon,,0HyperCube,0,2024-08-14T02:18:22Z,2025-01-19T21:59:50Z,2024-09-15T22:26:12Z,Milestone 41,No,"If you stick a Transform node underneath a layer stack, the whole stack gets moved even though, intuitively, it's applying to no data in the stack so far. If you stick the Transform node/layer in the middle of a stack, it affects both those layers above and below it. Definitely feels wrong.    That's because it is changing the final resulting GraphicGroup's `transform` field, instead of the transform on the individual layers up to that point which make up the partial stack (the part underneath the transform node).    The tricky part is preserving the correct behavior for rendering strokes (or gradient fills) which can get stretched and skewed.    This relates to #1930 and #1834."

This means you can overwrite one with a later one. But we would rather make it apply the moment the data arrives at each Fill or Stroke node, pushing to a Vec of styles (fills and strokes). Additionally, the transform of the shape in that moment should become stored in the stroke or fill (when gradients are used, that's relevant to fills, too). This lets you have multiple fills (useful when transparency is involved, especially with gradients) and strokes (allowing you to have multiple strokes on a single shape drawn on top of each other). It should also be possible to put the fill on top of the stroke, or vice versa, depending on the ordering of each node in the graph (and thus the Vec of styles on the VectorData).    This change also lets us apply subsquent transforms to the shape that skew the earlier-set fill, without requiring a Merge layer to get involved. See #1931.    This will allow us to eventually make a user-facing Style node which acts as a subgraph encapsulating various orders of Fill and Stroke nodes letting the user only worry about styling from the Properties panel UI (setting one fill and one stroke, choosing which is on top of which, etc.) without cluttering the graph with multiple nodes.

The node should have a secondary input that receives some graphical data to use as the clipping mask.    But if nothing is provided, it should instead default to clipping with the layer beneath this one in the stack. It does that by adding a ""clip on layer beneath"" field on the blending options for the layer, which will cause the Merge node to apply the blending as desired.    One more possibility is that we could change the blending options struct (which stores the opacity and blend mode) into a composable lambda. This would generalize opacity and blend modes, and other sorts of blending properties, into something controllable by nodes. The Merge node would then simply apply that lambda. Perhaps the lambda itself could be represented as a node graph."

This occurs because the boolean layer node has a Memoize Impure node inside of it, so the click targets are not updated when the document is panned.    Click targets are stored in layer space. In order to compare with the mouse it is necessary to calculate the transform from layer to viewport. We do this using `transform_to_document` which in tern uses the footprint. Footprints are always stored in viewport space. By not reprocessing the monitor node that stores the footprint, the click targets become offset.    The easiest fix is to remove the memoize impore node from the boolean node. Keavon claims that without this Memoize impure node, the performance is too bad. I'm not sure how else to approach this. "

This is because for each segment we iterate over, we must find the start and end position by resolving the PointId. This is done via linear search; it is slow when there are a large number of points and segments e.g. in the red dress demo artwork.    Instead of storing a PointId, the segment domain should store a usize index. This speeds up the common usecase of iterating over some segments, at the cost of having to update the indexes whenever a point is inserted or deleted. This tradeoff seems worthwhile given that we are already running into performance limitations of the current approach.    In order to facilitate procedural editing, the system of point ids will be kept.  Optimisations for the path modification node can be done seperately."

This **callstack-building** phase goes right-to-left, but it isn't the data model users think of when interacting with the graph UI, where data flows left-to-right. That phase happens when the **callstack-popping** phase goes left-to-right.    The **call argument** is what we pass along during the right-to-left callstack-building phase which allows, for example, **Footprint** to be used as the call argument to enable the adaptive resolution system. This is necessary because nodes, like the Transform node or the future Liquify node, need to modify the call argument before passing it along to its upstream (leftward) node. The call argument is also able to be edited on the fly between renders without any need to recompile the graph, which makes it useful to reduce the render latency when panning.    However, it's easier to think of nodes as blocks that process data flowing left-to-right as is the case in the graph UI. Usually, nodes will just pass along the call argument to its upstream (leftward) node. To avoid boilerplate involved in making every node handle the callstack-building phase by personally calling its upstream nodes with `.eval()` to get the data it depends on, we have the **automatic composition system** (**autocomp**) which inserts **compose nodes** so that nodes using autocomp don't have to think about right-to-left data flow at all. Those nodes can be implemented using just the left-to-right data flow conceptual model akin to the actual graph UI concepts. Any call arguments are passed through (but can't be read or modified) automatically along the primary data flow (but not secondary).    But that system was designed a while ago before the methodology of the adaptive resolution system was fleshed out. Autocomp has many limitations when the Footprint call argument has to be passed through to secondary inputs, or read (for example as part of a cull node), or edited (for example as part of a transform node). These cases all require opting for manual composition instead of autocomp, and it's becoming increasingly common for graphical nodes to do so, which reduces the value provided by the system.    The lack of standardization between the autocomp and manual comp conceptual models are also a significant burden for everyone using (and especially learning) the system, because the data flow directionality is counterintuitively reversed and the meaning of different function parameters in the `node_fn` proto node definition becomes a source of confusion. With autocomp, the function's first parameter is the user-facing node's primary input which doesn't appear in the node struct while all secondary inputs are found in the struct. But with manual comp, the function's first parameter is the call argument (Footprint) and both the user-facing node's primary and secondary inputs all appear in the struct. To avoid confusion, we instead want to standardize on that: where the call argument is always given (and the user may ignore it with `_`) and the primary input is always part of the struct just like the secondary inputs.    To address the above nonstandardization issues, the `node_fn` macro should be updated in a way that makes all cases have the same function signature expectations. It should also entirely auto-generate the struct to prevent confusion arising from it (and its weird use of type arguments that are basically a way to abuse Rust and Rust-Analyzer into working despite essentially building a DSL out of a Rust function rather than fully building our own DSL syntax that would lack tooling support).    We should also follow the trend (as we move towards the full catalog of nodes supporting the adaptive resolution system) of removing autocomp from nodes by ripping it out of all of them to retire the system, and then replace it with a similar system that has similar goals, but importantly: it gives access to the call argument in the `node_fn` macro's proto node function for direct use (and hopefully modification). For now, nodes will have to call `.eval()` on their upstream nodes to get their data, but we can then work towards abstracting that boilerplate further through the macro once we're in that position.    Another change to make this happen will be the removal of the graph rewriting step which auto-inserts compose nodes. It's worth noting that, because all nodes will be responsible for calling `.eval()` on their upstream nodes, we don't have a standardized way to hook into the composition system for distributed computing applications. But many of the performance-intensive nodes (the graphical ones) already opted out of autocomp anyways and did their own `.eval()` calls so this may be for the best anyways. When it's time to deal with distributed computation, we can add some kind of hook to the `.eval()` method itself or some other place for breaking up tasks across compute resources. That kind of hook will also be necessary for showing the progress of each node's execution within the graph UI (milliseconds spent per node, which ones have been executed or are waiting to be executed, etc.).    @TrueDoctor estimates 1 day for the macro syntax change, 1 day to migrate all the node usages, and 1 day to fix `.then()` usages in the node registry or other nodes that'll potentially also break.    The design for the node_fn macro's function signature usage should look like this:    ```rs  #[node_macro::node_fn]  fn cull_node<T>(footprint: Footprint, cullable_data: T, ...) -> T {      let returned_value_of_type_t = do_stuff(cullable_data);      returned_value_of_type_t  }  ```  ```rs  #[node_macro::node_fn]  async fn construct_layer_node<Data: Into<GraphicElement> + Send>(  	footprint: crate::transform::Footprint,  	mut stack: GraphicGroup,  	graphic_element: Data,  ) -> GraphicGroup {  	stack.push(graphic_element.into());  	stack  }  ```"

1870,Tracking Issue: Pen and Path tool improvements,closed,https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/1870,Keavon,"Good First Issue,Paper Cut",0SlowPoke0,11,2024-07-29T11:31:22Z,2025-07-02T02:44:53Z,2025-06-14T20:48:52Z,Milestone 49,No,"Much of this is explained/demonstrated in this detailed webcast: https://youtu.be/OmveqhzXJFg  Discord thread: https://discord.com/channels/731730685944922173/1319602515758682132  ## Path tool  When dragging a handle: - [x] <kbd>Alt</kbd> keeps the handles equidistant while pressed (instead of <kbd>Shift</kbd> in use now) (#2058) - [x] <kbd>Alt</kbd>, as part of keeping the handles equidistant, also creates a matching handle if the other is zero-length or not a cubic Bézier (#2196) - [x] <kbd>Shift</kbd> locks the handle angle to 15° increments (shouldn't interfere with <kbd>Shift</kbd>-clicking handles for multi-selecting points such as handles) (#2160) - [x] <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> locks the current angle of the handle (#2160)   - [x] If pressed while the non-colinear handle is over its anchor, it becomes temporarily colinear and is locked to the angle of its opposite handle, or if there is no opposite handle then it should not become colinear but it should become locked to the angle of its [shared adjacent segment angles](https://files.keavon.com/-/NovelGruesomePangolin/capture.png) (#2612)   - [x] If pressed while over the an adjacent anchor, it locks to handle dragging along its tangent line [*(video)*](https://files.keavon.com/-/InferiorIllinformedSableantelope/capture_25_.mp4), except if that anchor has no handles then it has no tangent; if it has split (non-colinear) handles then it uses the one on the side adjacent to the handle being dragged. (#2663) - [x] <kbd>Tab</kbd> swaps to dragging the opposite handle (native: teleports the cursor / web: enters pointer lock and draws a fake cursor at the new location) (#2058) - [x] <kbd>Space</kbd> shifts the anchor (and handles) while pressed (#2065) - [x] <kbd>C</kbd> toggles bent vs. colinear handles (instead of <kbd>Alt</kbd> in use now) (#2058)  When dragging an anchor: - [x] <kbd>Alt</kbd> **(new since video was recorded)**, if held during the start of the click-drag, converts the anchor's handles to colinear and drags the handle pair instead of the anchor, keeping them equidistant unless <kbd>Alt</kbd> is released to temporarily return the opposite handle back to where it started before the <kbd>Alt</kbd>-drag began (which involves returning its colinear state back to what it was before). Should work with <kbd>Tab</kbd> to swap which is the dragged handle, so its opposite can be the one that's returned if <kbd>Alt</kbd> is temporarily released. Just <kbd>Alt</kbd> clicking but not dragging the anchor should remove both handles by setting them to zero length. (#2496) - [x] <kbd>Shift</kbd>, locks the drag to the nearer of the X or Y axes from its drag starting point. (If pressed before the drag begins, it shouldn't break <kbd>Shift</kbd>-clicking points to add to the selection.) (#2449) - [x] <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> **(new since video was recorded)**, if pressed before the drag begins, should select and drag a zero-length handle out of its anchor locked to the angle of the opposite non-zero-length handle, which it should be made colinear to. This applies only to anchors with two handles where exactly one is zero-length. Otherwise, the key is ignored and the anchor is dragged per usual. One more scenario is where a non-endpoint anchor has no handles (they're both zero-length), if <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> (see previous bullet point) are both pressed before dragging, it locks the angle to that of the line perpendicular to the average of the two tangents [*(diagram)*](https://files.keavon.com/-/NovelGruesomePangolin/capture.png) from that anchor to its adjacent curves. (#2620)  When double-clicking an anchor **(new since video was recorded)**: - [x] Currently this swaps between smooth and sharp, but doesn't work if multiple handles are multi-selected to convert them all to smooth or sharp. If they're of mixed type, the specific one that's double clicked on should be the decider for the rest of them as to which they should all be swapped to. (#2498) - [x] If a single anchor is double clicked, and it has only one handle (the other is zero-length or doesn't exist), currently this converts it to sharp by removing the handle. But we want that to make the new handle colinear and extend it to an equal length as the present handle. Only if both handles are present, should double-clicking remove both handles like it does currently in that situation. And if both handles are gone, it should also do what it does now by restoring them as colinear. (#2620)  When clicking a segment **(new since video was recorded)**: - [x] Clicking without any modifier key should split the segment where clicked. Currently this has the extra complication of entering an insertion mode where the point of the segment split can be slid within the segment and left click confirms it while right click cancels. We want to remove that extra step and just insert directly. Important: clicking then immediately click-dragging to drag the point shouldn't become a double-click that converts from sharp to smooth. An overlay should be drawn in cases where the cursor is hovered over the segment such that clicking would insert a split, it should be a short line segment (20px in diameter) running perpendicular to the curve. (#2495) - [x] <kbd>Alt</kbd> clicking should delete the segment that's clicked. Currently a user would have to split the segment then delete the newly created point. (#2495) - [x] Clicking and dragging without any modifier key, as per #615, should [mold the segment](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/#molding). (#2660)  When a single handle is selected: - [x] <kbd>R</kbd> rotates about its anchor (#2180) - [x] <kbd>S</kbd> scales about its anchor (#2180)  ## Pen tool  When no drawing has begun yet (pointer is up): - [x] **(New since video was recorded)** clicking a path's endpoint should begin drawing from it with an initial handle that's colinear and equidistant from the opposite handle, instead of the current behavior where clicking the endpoint begins drawing the segment with a zero-length handle. If the user wants the current behavior, they can simply click the endpoint anchor a second time to make the current segment's handle zero-length. This solves the pain point that switching away from the Pen tool, then back to it, causes a discontinuity at the previous endpoint where the handles can't easily be opposite each other like when drawing consecutive segments normally. (#2295)  When stretching out a segment to be placed (pointer is up): - [x] <kbd>Backspace</kbd>/<kbd>Delete</kbd> removes the current segment's handle (equivalent to clicking the current anchor) (#2180) - [x] <kbd>G</kbd> grabs (translates) the current segment's connected outgoing handle (#2211) - [x] <kbd>R</kbd> rotates the current segment's connected outgoing handle about its anchor (#2211) - [x] <kbd>S</kbd> scales the current segment's connected outgoing handle about its anchor (#2211)  When dragging the handles of the segment being placed (pointer is down): - [x] <kbd>C</kbd> toggles bent vs. colinear handles (instead of the momentary <kbd>Alt</kbd> in use now) (#2242) - [x] <kbd>Alt</kbd> stops keeping the handles equidistant while pressed, as long as they're currently colinear (otherwise it does nothing). Exception: the reverse is the case (it keeps the handles equidistant while pressed) when the click-drag began with a single handle (either by click-dragging the current segment's connected anchor, click-dragging an endpoint of an existing not-yet-being-edited layer, or click-dragging the start point to close the shape) but <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> was pressed to keep (#2242) - [x] <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> locks the current angle of the handle (already implemented), but should also work to be colinear with the opposite handle if being dragged out of an existing anchor point, or if that anchor point has no handle then it should use the angle of the actual curve segment entering that handle, i.e. its tangent angle at its endpoint (#2284) - [x] <kbd>Space</kbd> shifts the anchor (and handles) while pressed (#2416) - [x] <kbd>Tab</kbd> swaps to dragging the opposite handle (native: teleports the cursor / web: enters pointer lock and draws a fake cursor at the new location) (#2452) - [x] If the current segment is closing the shape by connecting to its start point, the handle that's being dragged should be the closing handle, not a fake handle on the opposite side, and all the above shortcuts should work on that anchor/handle group spanning the start/end point (<kbd>Tab</kbd> will modify the shape of the first segment while the current/final segment is still in-progress) (#2452) - [x] All the above shortcuts should work with the ""Bend Prev. Point"" case where the current segment's connected anchor can be clicked to turn it sharp or click-dragged to bend its outgoing handle (turning its handles to not colinear), meaning <kbd>C</kbd> should be able to turn it back to colinear"

1813,Add a stack-based Boolean Operation layer node,closed,https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/pull/1813,adamgerhant,,,0,2024-07-07T20:17:28Z,2024-07-10T09:12:57Z,2024-07-10T09:12:56Z,,Sí,"Closes #1816    Adds a layer Boolean operation node which performs the Boolean operation on an entire stack of vector data. This means the layer panel can now be used to adjust the operation order.     https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/assets/116332429/a2da538c-3a9f-4409-8bb6-d15f3c04259d    Since operations can now be performed on more than 2 shapes, the order and merging of these operations into a single vector will have to be carefully considered.  - Union: Accumulate all shapes into a single result by repeatedly setting the result to the union of of each layer and the result.  - Subtract front: Union all shapes other than the first shape, then subtract the first shape from this union.  - Subtract back: Rotate the list of vector data right one so that the last shape is at the start of the list, and subtract front.  - Intersect (area where all shapes overlap): Accumulate all shapes into a single result by repeatedly setting the result to the intersection of each layer and the result.  - Difference (area where no shapes overlap): Accumulate all shapes into a single result by repeatedly finding intersection of each layer and the result, then union this intersection with the result. This provides the area where there is at least one intersection. Then find the union of all shapes, and subtract the result.  - Divide (Show all lines for each shape): Not currently implemented due to limitations with current rendering method.    Another consideration is that a `GraphicGroup` can contain elements other than vector data. Currently, each element can be either another `GraphicGroup`, `VectorData`, `Image`, or `Artboard`. For `GraphicGroup`'s and Artboards, a recursive Boolean union is applied to convert them into a a single vector. Image's are treated as default rectangles based on their height, width, and position, although this will have to be reworked. Maybe a mask should be used instead of the Boolean operation?    It would also be helpful to allow the user to specify a minimum and maximum number of overlaps for the resulting shape. For example a union would have a minimum of 0 overlaps and no maximum, intersect sets the minimum to the number of shapes - 1 and no maximum, and difference sets the minimum to 0 and maximum to 1. The UI for this could be a single slider bar with the number of ticks equal to the number of shapes in the stack, and 2 selectors for the minimum and maximum. This could be a new node ""Intersect"".    A more flexible implementation for the Boolean operation could take the following inputs: List of vector data (`GraphicGroup`), minimum overlap(`RelativeOffset`), maximum overlap (`RelativeOffset`), subtract index (`Option<RelativeOffset>`). The relative offset will be an enum with 2 varients, FromStart(usize) and FromBack(usize). This is necessary to ensure indices can be based of either the start of end of the vector data, so that adding a new item to the stack does not require the indices to be manually updated. For example, union will store a minimum offset of `RelativeOffset::FromStart(0)` and a maximum offset of `RelativeOffset::FromEnd(0)`.    Since subtracting is fundamentally different than the intersection selection, it should be a separate node. If the subtract index is Some, then it will get that index from the list of vector data and subtract it from the Union of all vector data. This Union will be created by output of the new Intersect node.

This PR will migrate click detection, translation/scale and wire calculations from Graph.svelte to the NodeGraphMessageHandler. Instead of relying on the DOM and JavaScript click detection to get positions for various elements and send messages via editor.handle, all logic and calculations will be performed in the NodeGraphMessageHandler. Since Rust only has access to the node and wire data, all positioning functions that previously used the DOM will have to be recreated. This includes  - `closest()` which will calculate the bounding box for each node using [SDFs]([Rounding Corners in SDFs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5NGeUV2EyU)) and offscreen text rendering to check if a click event occurred within a node or node input  - `getBoundingClientRect()`, which will get the position of node inputs and outputs in node graph coordinates    - a new function `NodeGraphToPixelCoordinates()`, which will convert the node graph position to pixel coordinates that can be compared with the click event    Another important concept will be to store positions in node graph coordinates, and derive pixel coordinates when needed using the current transform (position/scale). This should solve a current issue where scaling the node graph breaks the automatic node insertion on a wire.    Other features  - Autopan when cursor is node is being dragged and cursor goes outside nod graph  - Make scroll bars functional and display scroll bars based on current transform  - Move blue selection box highlighting nodes before they are selected to Rust  - Cache ClickTargets (`HashMap<NodeId, ClickTarget>`) and keep them in sync with the visual nodes by making inputs, metadata (position), and is_layer, and eventually name private fields, and creating getters/setters that keep the cache in sync. This removes the 50ms per frame requires to calculate bounding boxes.   - Cache bounding box for viewport artwork  Also cache the bounding box around the entire node network, and convert to viewport coordinates when rendering scrollbars. Keep all coordinates in node graph coordinates, and only use the transform to convert mouse position to node graph coordinates, or converting the bounding box to viewport coordinates.      Issues:  - Clicking CreateComputePass crashes, likely an issue caused by my last PR  - [x] Pressing Shift causes the last box selection's blue box to reappear for some reason, as does right-clicking  - [x] Ctrl+0 (or View > Zoom to Fit All) just teleports the origin to the top left but doesn't center the entire node graph contents like it should  - [x] Numpad Period (or View > Zoom to Fit Selection) just seems to zoom out a little bit rather than zooming to center and fit the selected nodes (it's nice to see that the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons work though!)  - [x] We'll want to gray out View > Tilt and View > Reset Tilt  - [x] Ctrl+Z doesnt add click targets back  - [x] 	// TODO: Find a better way to update click targets when undoing/redoing  - [x] Save node_graph_transform: PTZ for every network  "

This is because although the hidden `Type`'s are stored in the `TypingContext`, the `document_node_types(&self) -> ResolvedDocumentNodeTypes` function only gets types for inputs in the `BorrowTree` inputs_source_map. To fix this, all inputs need to be added to the inputs_source_map. I believe this will require a rework to how exposed inputs are handled. Is there even a reason to consider whether the input is hidden when compiling into proto nodes? Hiding an input is a UI only concept, the value node still has the same functionality.    This image shows the error. The Type is a `(Concrete(())->Concrete(bool))`, and is correctly passed to the next node, but it is displayed as General  ![ApplicationFrameHost_Tip9Bq6YOi](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/assets/116332429/f603afe0-0137-4342-8d52-1c3f99dc3ea3)    I think this is purely visual, and doesn't affect any functionality.

Another example is when trying to disconnect the combine/split channel nodes.

Another observation is that the second inputs source map retains all the sources from the previous document (artboard id 17505474457066797865). It seems that the root issue is that the borrow tree is not being reset when changing networks. This means the nodes are being preserved, so nodes in the protonetwork for the new document are being skipped here:  ```  if !self.nodes.contains_key(&id) {      self.push_node(id, node, typing_context).await?;  }  ```    I think a solution could be to reset the borrow tree when switching documents, but I'm not sure what other effects this would have."

1741,Contravariance for node inputs with automatic coercion,closed,https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/1741,TrueDoctor,,TrueDoctor,0,2024-05-07T20:43:21Z,2024-06-02T08:07:45Z,2024-05-07T23:36:26Z,Milestone 37,No,"**RFC: Contravariance for node inputs with automatic coercion:**  *Current Status:*  Currently the types supplied to functions are treated as invariant.  If node A is chained with node B and B expects an input of `T → V`, the type of node A has to be exactly `T → V`.   *Suggested Changes:*  Node inputs should be allowed to be **contravariant**. That means if the signature of A can be `T' → V` as long as T' ∝  T (With ∝ denoting the subtyping relation) = as long as T is more general than T'.  We then need to define a subtyping relation to have `()` to be the root of that relation.  In practice that means that any node which expects `T → V` can also take a node with `() -> V` as input.  *Implementation:*  For the implementation we have to consider two things: the type checking and the type coercion.  It should be pretty easy to extend the type checking to support contravariant function arguments.  Type coercion is a bit tricker, when using rustc for compilation we could just express this relationship using traits but due to the dynamic execution that is infeasible as it would lead to a type explosion for the node implementations.  Instead we'll have to insert explicit nodes to perform the conversion which work much like the cull node does currently.  *Performance Impact:*  When compiling with rustc this does not cause any runtime overhead. When linking the graph dynamically, it add the cost of calling an extra node. The compilation overhead is expected to be minimal.  *Open questions:*  How do we communicate this to the user / developer? When a chain A - B - C of nodes is created and A, C are resolution aware and B is not resolution aware, the typesystem would complain that the link between A and B is invalid even though node B itself is the problem, somewhat obfuscating the error.  *Alternatives:*  * Manually placing conversion nodes as necessary and adding more tooling to fix special cases like the bottom of a layer stack.  * Forcing everything to be resolution aware (this complicates caching, has a negative impact on performance and would be confusing to reason about)"

It causes Safari to render the popover by about a 130px upward offset. However, the click targets and devtools hover highlight visualizations for the elements in this popover do show up in the correct location, so this only affects how Safari paints the content.    https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/assets/4388688/575d079d-803d-4fc5-8194-8ec977142a32    - It only occurs if there exists a scrollbar in the Properties panel      - But strangely, it doesn't happen if there exists a scrollbar in the Layers panel— something must somehow be different between those two panels  - It only occurs if the tool shelf has at least two columns      - However, it being two or three columns doesn't affect how tall the ~130px upward offset is      - Deleting the `.tools` container will visibly shrink the shelf back to a width of 1 column, but doesn't stop the issue from occurring until the web page gets resized  - Disabling `container-type: size;` on the `.shelf-and-table` element prevents the issue from occurring    We need to investigate this further, ideally create a minimal reproduction test case, and report this. Then *hope* it's fixed. Or, find a particular way that we can change things to mitigate this on our end.    This is tested on Safari 16.5, and I've more recently tested it on 17.3.    `container-type` was added in Safari 16 (released 2022-09-12).    ---    ### Reproduction steps:    1. Open https://editor.graphite.rs/  2. Make a new document  3. Reduce the height of the web page such that the drawing tools on the left become two columns (this happens via `container-type: size` and some `calc()` magic)  4. Draw a rectangle and make sure it's selected, in order to populate the top-right Properties panel such that it has enough content to overflow and cause a vertical scrollbar  5. Click either of the black or white color circles beneath the drawing tools at the bottom left of the UI  6. This should be drawn at the bottom left corner of the web app, but it gets painted ~130px higher than it's supposed to be— but hover over the correct locations of buttons and you'll see it interact with the incorrectly offset painted buttons  7. Resize the Properties panel downwards so it has enough space to avoid needing scrollbars for its content (but don't resize the page to cause the drawing tools to become single-column)— and notice that the offset bug goes away, even though the Properties panel has no child/ancestor relationship with the tools and color picker"

So my approach was to add a `DocumentMessage::ImportSvg` ... which pretty much tries to create a `usvg::Tree` the same way as `GraphOperationMessage::NewSvg` does... with the exception that it doesn't care about the result... only cares about the succesful unwraping `Ok(_)` of the `Option<Tree>` and then proceeds to send the original message (and calls self.backup(responses) before)    Now ofcourse the idea of just deserializing the tree and sending that crossed my mind but after investigating serde I realized it would just be a reimplementation of their `Tree::to_string` method which seemed pointless.  I'll look into what is your branching strategy and I'll submit a PR so that you can take a look at it  Maybe just to add... of course an option would be to just `self.backup(...) `on every `GraphOperationMessage` received by `DocumentMessageHandler`... but that would lead to undesired behaviour with some of the other tools that work with vector graphics"

I think the node could also blend the fill and stroke of the shapes, similar to how in the video the color of the different meshes are blended.    For reference this is my original message in Discord where I asked if this was possible:    ""Another cool feature that I think might work with vector graphics would be sliders to change proportions. I think in 3D that is usually done with morph targets.    When there is support for editing keyframes I imagine that making e.g. length and width sliders could work like this:  - Have 4 keyframes for a body part: ""short and thin"", ""long and thin"", ""short and thick"", ""long and thick""  - Calculate two temporary keyframes by interpolating between ""short and thin""/""long and thin"" and ""short and thick""/""long and thick"" with the desired length value  - Interpolating between those temporary keyframes with the desired width value"""

This is done to allow us to compile chunks of the node graph which is very important for performance (without this we need to do one heap allocation per pixel when doing image processing -> we could try to use something like smallbox to circumvent this). Still the current state is pretty confusing (choosing which nodes should be async etc.). The let node is also not very pretty, we could think about making the editor api a value node which nodes can depend on and move the footprint out of the editor api. We could then implement a proper compilation cache by traversing the graph from the root and computing stable node ids on subgraphs which can be used to query the compilation cache. This would decouple the speed optimizations from the actual node implementation and pave the way for a compilation server providing implementations for compiled subgraphs. Ideally this would also allow us to const eval the shader compilation to move the shader compilation from graph runtime to graph compile time. I'd also like to experiment with running a wasm interpreter in wasm as a polyfill until we have proper dynamic linking support to basically have the ability to execute and optimze arbitrary graphs."
